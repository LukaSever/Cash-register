Cash register ( C# Project )

This program simulates a cash register in a store. 
At the beginning, you can choose Administration and Statistics. 
In the Administration section, you can update categories ( add, update, and delete categories ). 
By clicking on the “Update Items” tab, you can manage items ( add, update, and delete items ). 
In the Statistics section, you can view statistics by selecting a date to see the product names and quantities sold. 
You can also track the percentage of a specific item sold on that day through a progress bar.

After exiting, you can choose Sales/Payment to open the cash register. 
By selecting a category, its products will appear.
Clicking on a product prepares it for purchase.
If you click “Enter” without specifying the quantity, it will automatically add one product. 
If you enter multiple identical items, their quantities will be summed up automatically. 
By clicking “Next” or the “Fiscal Receipt” tab, a fiscal receipt will open, showing the product names, their prices for the specified quantities, and the total amount at the bottom. 
By clicking the “Save” button, the transaction is saved in the Microsoft SQL database. 
If alcohol is entered and the sale occurs after 10 PM, the purchase will be disabled, and the attempt will be recorded in a separate file.
